## Overview
For each data frame in an .mxd, df-zoom pans to an extent that includes all layers in the data frame. It is the equivalent of right-clicking on a layer or layer group and selecting "Zoom to Layer" or "Zoom to Layers". But who wants to do that?

Good for "beautifying" .mxds that have many data frames.
